# Mapping_Earthquakes
Earthquake Mapping using GeoJSON data using JavaScript with D3 and Leaflet libraries.
Here, a map of earthquakes around the globe is created along with a legend indicating the
intensity of the earthquake.  Also, a layer is added that shows Earth's techtonic plates so the earthquake data can be seen in relation to the plates.  There are 3 map tile layers that show the map as a street map, a satellite map, or an outdoor map.
